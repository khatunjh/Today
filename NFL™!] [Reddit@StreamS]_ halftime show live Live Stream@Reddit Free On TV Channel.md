Super Bowl 2025 live stream: How to watch online, on a TV, or without cable, including free options


Are you ready for it? February 9 is Super Bowl Sunday. The Kansas City Chiefs are looking for the first-ever “three-peat” in Super Bowl history, while the Philadelphia Eagles are looking for redemption after their last unsuccessful attempt for the Lombardi Trophy . . . against the Chiefs. Super Bowl LIX is a rematch of Super Bowl LVII, in 2023, which the Chiefs won 38-35, and was the start of their three-peat quest. (Fun fact: The term three-peat was actually trademarked by NBA legend Pat Riley back in the late 1980s when he was head coach of the L.A. Lakers. This past week, the NFL struck a deal with Riley to use it if the Chiefs win.)

Here’s what you need to know about Super Bowl LIX at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, including where to tune in and how to stream it live:

High interest in Super Bowl 2025 commercials
While diehard sports fans are hoping to see a great game with some really stellar plays, other viewers are there for the halftime show or maybe even the commercials. Not your basic TV commercials, Super Bowl commercials can captivate a crowd sometimes as much as the game itself (sometimes more).

That’s because brands spend big bucks on Super Bowl commercials, and ad agencies burn countless brain cells coming up with clever and creative campaigns. The reason? The Super Bowl is the most-watched TV broadcast in the U.S. every year. Some of the ads for Super Bowl 59 have been teased or even released ahead of time in an effort to create more buzz: For a Hellmann’s Mayonnaise spot called “When Sally Met Hellmann’s,” Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal recreate the famous deli scene from 1989’s When Harry Met Sally. For Taco Bell, rapper Doja Cat is caught in a Taco Bell drive-through, and David Beckham learned some family secrets when working with Stella Artois.

Technically, winning three consecutive championship games has been done before in the NFL, just not in the so-called Super Bowl era. In 1966, the National Football League (NFL) and the American Football League (AFL) merged and created the Super Bowl as the championship game. This change wiped previous records, so stats before the merger are not officially counted. If they were, the Green Bay Packers would be credited for having “three-peated” twice.

How to watch the Super Bowl on a TV
Viewers with traditional cable or an over-the-air antenna can tune in to Fox: Game time is 6:30 p.m. ET, with the pregame kicking off at 1 p.m. ET. And in a pair of firsts, Tom Brady makes his debut calling the game for Fox Sports from the broadcast booth in the Superdome, where he won his first Super Bowl as quarterback for the New England Patriots in 2002.

You can also see the game on a live-TV streaming service that includes Fox as part of a bundle, including:

Note: This is the first time the Super Bowl will be available on Tubi, where viewers can watch it for free.
