So how do you watch? The 2025 Kitten Bowl will be on at 12 p.m. ET, with a broadcast on the Great American Family channel. If you have Fubo ... The Great American Rescue Bowl will air on the Great American Family Channel for the second consecutive year. 

What could make Super Bowl Sunday even better? Kittens and puppies, of course. The 2025 Great American Rescue Bowl will be the perfect warmup ahead of Chiefs-Eagles.

This weekend, dozens of kittens and puppies will take part in a furry football game with the goal of bringing awareness to animal homelessness. The 3rd annual Kitten Bowl, formally known as the Great American Rescue Bowl, will give many rescue animals the chance to find their forever homes.

North Shore Animal League America will be at the center of the adoption efforts once again, as the feline and canine players are split into two teams — the Sweetie Pies and the Totally Take Me Homes.

Be sure to tune into the frenzy. Here's everything you need to know about the 2025 Kitten Bowl, including TV channel and streaming options for the annual event.
