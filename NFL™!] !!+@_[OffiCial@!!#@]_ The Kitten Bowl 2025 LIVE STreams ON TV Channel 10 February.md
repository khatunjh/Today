To celebrate International Dog Day on Aug. 26, Great American Family announced the return of the Great American Rescue Bowl in 2025. The third annual event will be broadcast on Super Bowl Sunday (Feb. 9, 2025) in partnership with the North Shore Animal League America, the world's largest no-kill rescue and adoption organization.

Formerly known as The Kitten Bowl and previously airing on Hallmark Channel, Great American Family snapped up the purr-fect program when Hallmark dropped the event in 2022. The Bill Abbott-led upstart network aired its first Rescue Bowl in 2023 and we can't wait to see what's in store for 2025.

Much like late music superstar Prince, the Great American Rescue Bowl was formerly known as The Kitten Bowl. The special is a cat- and dog-filled gridiron throwdown of pets looking for their fur-ever homes. The two-hour adoption event offers a fun and furry alternative to the Super Bowl and includes adult dogs and cats as well as puppies and kittens playing on a football-themed stage. Between the turnovers and touchdowns, the special features heartwarming stories of pet lives saved through fostering.

The Great American Rescue Bowl's goal is to raise awareness of pet adoption and reveal the beautiful pets available in shelters right in your own neighborhood. "Saving pet lives has been a personal mission of mine for more than a decade and North Shore Animal League America is a profound partner in saving as many homeless pets as possible each year," said Bill Abbott, president and CEO of Great American Media. "I am always grateful to showcase these cuddly animals available for adoption because every life saved brings us one step closer to emptying the shelters forever," Abbott added.
